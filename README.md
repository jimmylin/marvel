# marvel
Description: AWS Alexa skill that queries the Marvel api for a character and reads you the description of the character.

## Getting Started
This code was based off of a tutorial that can be found here: https://github.com/jbasdf/spaceball

Here is the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQig94h4Ms

To use the Marvel API (http://developer.marvel.com/) you need to create an account and get you public key and your private key and enter those in to src/lambda.js where <marvel private key> and <marvel api key> are.
You use the intentSchema.js, HeroesSlotType, and SampleUtterances files to set up your Alexa skill.  

Have fun!!
